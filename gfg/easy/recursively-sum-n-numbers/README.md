![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**, recursively sum the numbers from 1 to n and return the sum.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: Sum from 1 to 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
```

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: Sum from 1 to 4 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
```

 **Constraints:** 
0 ≤ n ≤ 100

```java
class Solution {
    public int recursiveSum(int n) {
        // code here
        if(n == 1 || n == 0){
            return n;
        }
        return n + recursiveSum(n-1);
    }
}
```
