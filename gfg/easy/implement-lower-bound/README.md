# Implement Lower Bound

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a sorted array  **arr[]** (following 0-based indexing) and a number  **target**, find the lower bound of the target in this given array.

- The lower bound of a number is defined as the smallest index in the sorted array where the element is greater than or equal to the given number.
- If all the elements in the given array are smaller than the target, the lower bound will be the length of the array. 

 **Examples :** 

```
Input:  arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[] where element (arr[3] = 10) is greater than or equal to 9.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 11
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 is the smallest index in arr[] where element (arr[4] = 11) is greater than or equal to 11.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 100
Output: 7
Explanation: As no element in arr[] is greater than 100, return the length of array.
```

```java
class Solution {
    int lowerBound(int[] arr, int target) {
        // code here
        int low = 0; 
        int high = arr.length-1; 
        int ans = arr.length;
        while(low <= high){
            int mid = low+(high-low)/2;
            if(arr[mid] >= target){
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            }else{
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
