# Prime Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**, determine whether it is a  **prime number**  or not.
 **Note:**  A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Examples :
**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 25
Output: false
Explanation: 25 has more than two divisors: 1, 5, and 25, so it is not a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered prime.
```

```java
class Solution {
    static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        // code here
        if(n <= 1){
            return false;
        } 
        if(n == 2){
            return true;
        }
        for(int i=2; i<=Math.sqrt(n); i++){
            if(n%i == 0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
}
```
